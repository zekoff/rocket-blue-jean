*GMS2 lessons learned from making this game*
- Negative values evaluate to FALSE in GMS2
- Also rumored that values of less than 0.5 also evaluate to false
- Whatever the window canvas size is set to when the game initializes into the first room, 
it won't change (even if other rooms/viewports should cause it to resize differently)
- If a child collision event and a parent collision event both exist, and a child coolides,
only the child collision event will fire
- Objects not marked visible will still process (just not draw)
- xprevious/yprevious are set to x/y of previous frame before the Step phase
- hspeed/vspeed are used to update x/y between Step and Draw phases (same for gravity, friction)
- Direction will update to match changes in hspeed/vspeed
- The room at the top of the Resource explorer will run first
